# DoodleZone

Hello and welcome to the repository for DoodleZone, a simple app I created as my class project for WPI's CS 3041 Human Computer Interaction course.  In this repository, you will find all of the code!

## Goals

The goal of DoodleZone is to create a basic web application that lets players connect with each other and enjoy an interactive digital experience.  The project had several sub goals, of which unfortunately only a few were achieved.  These were a) A groovy interface b) A fun doodlign system and c) Multiplayer integration.  While the first two were achieved, the multiplayer integration code was never made to work, and had to be left out of the final version of the software :(

## Running it yourself

To run the app yourself, simply download it and place the files where your favorite web server software can find them.  Then, navigate on in and have some fun!
